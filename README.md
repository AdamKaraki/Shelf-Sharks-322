# CPTS 322 Project

You  will  be  developing  a  librarian  assistant  that  helps  a  librarian  manage  common 
library-management  tasks,  including  user  registration,  book  search,  placing  hold  on  a 
book,  checking out a book, and returning a book, etc. You may need to use a database 
of book information to support this application. Users can also browse the books in the 
library and look into the details about each book selected. The user interface could be a 
desktop application or a website portal. 
 
You may use your creativity to determine which properties/attributes each book should 
have. You are encouraged to sit with a WSU librarian to understand details 
3 
 
requirements of the application assuming that the librarian would end up with using this 
software for their routine tasks.
