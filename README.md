# Shelf Sharks

We will be developing a librarian assistant that helps a librarian manage common
library-management tasks, including user registration, book search, placing hold on a
book, checking out a book, and returning a book, etc. We use a database
of book information to support this application. Users can also browse the books in the
library and look into the details about each book selected. The user interface is a website portal.
